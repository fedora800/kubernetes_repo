# a simple non-exiting ubuntu pod that will contain tools like apt, nslookup, telnet, ping and other debug utilities 
# as other app pods are very lean and distro-less and have nothing in them for tblshooting 
# we can attach this container into a misbehaving pod and see whatâ€™s going on directly.
# BUT, even ubuntu image DOES NOT have those tools, i saw some others use busybox
# or try this - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/debug-running-pod/#ephemeral-container
